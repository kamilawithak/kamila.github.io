<p id="bio"> Hey there! I’m Kamila Nieto. I love diving into books, playing the violin, and picking up new hobbies. I’m fluent in both English and Spanish. Right now, I’m a senior at Butler Tech, focusing on IT. My dream is to study computer science in college and become a software engineer. I run my own small business called 'Clara' as a web designer! I’m familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python, and I’m currently learning C#. Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about what I love to do! Contact me at <a href="mailto:nietokamila329@gmail.com"> nietokamila329@gmail.com </a> with any questions!</p>
