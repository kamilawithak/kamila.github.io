<p id="bio"> Welcome to my website! I am currently a junior at Butler Tech studying IT, and plan on going to college for computer science to become a software engineer. I am a web designer and currently run my own business! I enjoy reading, playing violin, and learning new skills. I speak English and Spanish. I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and I am currently learning C#. Feel free to check out my portfolio to get a more in-depth look into my hobbies and interests or contact me at <a href="mailto:nietokamila329@gmail.com"> nietokamila329@gmail.com </a> with any questions!
