<p id="bio"> Hey there! I’m Kamila Nieto. I am a graduate of Hamilton High School and Butler Tech's IT program, and I now attend The Ohio State University. At Ohio State I currently work as an IT Analyst and tutor. I am a part of the Morrill Scholarship Program and STEM Exploration and Engagement LLC! My dream is to get my bachelor's in computer science and become a software engineer. I’m familiar with HTML5, Python, MATLAB, AWS, and I’m currently learning C# and Java. Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about what I love to do! Contact me at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamila-nieto">LinkedIn</a> or at<a href="mailto:nietokamila329@gmail.com"> nietokamila329@gmail.com </a> with any questions!</p>
